# UnionPay System - API Documentation

I've created a comprehensive landing page for the UnionPay system and a detailed API documentation page that outlines all the endpoints the backend developer will need to implement. Here's a summary of what I've provided:

## Landing Page

The landing page showcases the UnionPay system with:

- A professional header with navigation and call-to-action buttons
- A hero section highlighting the system's purpose for construction workers
- Feature sections detailing the core functionality (member management, payments, loans, etc.)
- How it works section explaining the process for different user types
- Testimonials from users
- Call-to-action section to encourage sign-ups
